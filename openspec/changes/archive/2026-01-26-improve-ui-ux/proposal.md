# Proposal: Improve UI/UX

## Goal
Optimize the Maputnik interface with a focus on layout, typography, and theming using the `ui-ux-pro-max` design system.

## Why
The current UI needs a refresh to meet modern professional standards for developer tools. Improving aesthetics and usability will enhance the user experience.

## Capabilities
- **Enhanced Layout**: Professional spacing, meaningful hierarchy, and responsive containers.
- **Modern Typography**: Readable fonts, proper scaling for density-heavy UI.
- **Refined Theming**: Consistent color palette, clear contrast, and polished look-and-feel.

## Success Criteria
- Design system applied consistently.
- Improved visual hierarchy.
- No regressions in functionality.
